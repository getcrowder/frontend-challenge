#Frontend Challenge

This is our challenge for Frontend Developers at @get_crowder

####About the challenge

We'll give you some requirements that must be done and for which you'll be evaluated, but you're free to choose a solution method.

####What we expect to learn from you with this challenge:

* Your work style.
* How you think and solve problems.
* How you communicate.

####Next steps

* Fork this repository to your personal account.
* Follow the instructions in the challenge-description file.
* Solve the challenge in the best way you can.
* Send us a PR with your solution.

####How to face the challenge

* You can use any resource you like, we do too.
* There are no rules in terms of libraries you can add to the project, but keep in mind we will evaluate coherence
* Think, then code. We will evaluate not only the code, but how you faced the problem and the solution you came up with.
* Write code that is clean and easy to read. Code that "just works" doesn't work for us.

####Doubts?

Do you have in doubt related to the process? Open an issue and we'll be happy to help.
